```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("Shijia1997/ADMerge",upgrade = "never")
library(ADMerge)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r}
data_path = "ADNI data"

scr_table = get_src_table(path = data_path, ID_usr_list = c("RID"),DATE_usr_list = c("VISDATE","EXAMDATE"))

print(scr_table)
```

Each file identified as longitudinal will be join with the their "ID_for_merge" as y-axis and "DATE_for_merge" as x-axis for visualization.

By pass the source table into the "plot.files" function, we are able to visualize the distribution.

```{r}
plot.files(path = data_path, dict_src = scr_table)
```
