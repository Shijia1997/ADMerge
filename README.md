# AdMerge
Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Biomarker Collection Package.

With sharp increases in AD cases, deaths, and costs stressing the health care system and caregivers, several major AD data sources exist which allow researchers to conduct their research. For example, the BIOCARD study is a longitudinal, observational study initiated in 1995, and designed to identify biomarkers associated with progression from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment or dementia; the ADNI study is a multicenter observation study launched in 2004, to collect clinical, imaging, genetic and biospecimen biomarkers from cohorts of different clinical states at baseline; the NACC UDS data is a collection of data reflecting the total enrollment since 2005 across 34 AD Centers and includes subjects with a range of cognitive status. 

The ADMerge Package provides a function, ad_merge(), that merges data from various AD data sources to create a analysis dataset.This package establishes AD data standards and data dictionaries that define the formats and organization structures of the AD data across multiple data sources. R functions are provided for data analysts to integrate data from multiple data sources and create their analysis datasets.
